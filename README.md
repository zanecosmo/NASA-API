# NASA API
An experimental webpage designed to retrieve the NASA APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day). 

I'm interested in astronomy, so I made this page just to entertain myself.

#### Possible Features:
- Employ other interesting parts of NASA's API (for there are many).
- Adjust the arrow buttons such that they are fixed to the left and right of the image, to avoid having to scroll back up to go to the next one.

It is not hosted anywhere, as it is purely for my own entertainment, but I may end up putting it in an AWS S3 bucket after some alterations.

## About
This project uses ReactJS and the NASA API.
